\section{Agent Interface}

There are a number of interfaces that are usable by client applications
to interface directly with the policy agents.  Both remote and local
requests are handled similarily, through the agent connection and query
interfaces as documented below.  Within the same agent connection,
multiple requests are possible prior to issuing a disconnect.  Thus,
state information regarding the connection is persistent and resources
are not freed until the connection is explicitly closed.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4cm}|p{8cm}|}
\hline
Function & Arguments & Description \\
\hline
agent\_connect &
char *agenthost,
unsigned short port,
int options &
This function connects to both the local policy agent or across the
network to a global policy agent as applicable.  For remote connections,
the hostname must be specified.  If the port is provided, it will override
the compiled in default.  The options for the connection are for future
enhancements to specify additional negotiation capabilities for requests
(i.e., encryption). \\

\hline 
agent\_disconnect &
none &
This is the inverse to the connect function.  Every connect should be
appropriately followed by a disconnect.  If a disconnect does not occur,
resources are freed automatically based on program termination.  Resources
are freed earlier if explictly called. \\

\hline
set\_device\_pstate &
int dev,
int current\_state &
Transition the indicated device to the provided state. In order to transition
the device, the state information must already be known \\
