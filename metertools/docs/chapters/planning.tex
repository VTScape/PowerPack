\section{Planning}
Planning your installation is straightforward, the first decision is to
choose a location for the install process.   By specifying the
installation prefix, all appropriate binaries, man pages, libraries,
and header files will be placed into your provided directory.  If
the prefix is not given, /usr/local is used.  It is highly recommended
that the software is installed into a location of your choice for
future maintenance.

Once installation is complete, binaries are located in the bin
directory, libraries in lib, and header files in include.
