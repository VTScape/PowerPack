\section{Compilation}
Compilation for this software is handled by the GNU configure system.
For maintainers, the complete system can be rebuilt using the autogen.sh
shell script.  Modifications, of course, should be made to the
configure.ac and Makefile.am files located throughout the project
directories.

If you are unfamiliar with GNU configure, see the INSTALL file for
general configuration instructions.  In addition, the following additions
should be considered along with the base options.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{l p{12cm}}
--with-tcp-port=PORT &
Set the default TCP port for network connections in the \emph{mlogger}
and \emph{mclient} tools.  This can also be changed on startup with these
tools.\\
