/*
 * The following routines allow you to utilize network-enabled network
 * meter reading functionality.  This is useful if you have multiple
 * meters and need to access them all across the network or have a
 * meter that you want to read periodically in real-time according to a
 * schedule on a different node.  All these methods use the mlogger
 * command line tool to startup the logging on the system the meter
 * is connected to.  The following is an example of compiling and
 * using the below functionality (for compiling add appropriate -I and -L
 * options):
 *
 * compiling example.c using: gcc -lmeter -lsupport -o example example.c
 *
 * #include <stdio.h>
 * #include <sys/socket.h>
 * #include "meter.h"
 *
 * #define READINGS			10
 *
 * int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *    int sock;
 *    netmeter_req_t request;
 *    mm_t mm;
 *
 *    if ((sock = netmeter_connect(NULL, 0) == -1)) {
 *       fprintf(stderr, "unable to connect\n");
 *       return -1;
 *    }
 *    for (i = 0; i < READINGS; i++) {
 *       request.cmd = NETMETER_CMD_READ;
 *       netmeter_request(&request);
 *       netmeter_convert(&request, &mm);
 *       printf("reading: %f %s%s\n", mm.value,
 *          meter_units_prefix(&mm), meter_units_measure(&mm));
 *    }
 *    netmeter_close();
 *
 *    return 0;
 * }
 *
 * Note that you should not just add "netmeter.h" with an include
 * statement as types and definitions are also in meter.h (which
 * includes this file).
