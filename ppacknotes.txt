NI server -- binary that runs on Windows

If we want to want run another GPU, we have to copy paste the binary, 
change the config, and that'll act as another binary.


Dory cluster
-have to connect to dory before connecting to linux box or windows

linux -- ssh n240 

172.16.0.240 linux box ip

metertools_4.0_n11_s240_20130409/src/tool/mcontrol
src/tools/mcontrol -- where all th server daemons are places

mserver and multiserver
	1)start mserver
	before starting mserver
		sudo nohup ./mserver -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -o -p 6911 &

	-s <usbportname>
	-o -p <port number assigned to service>

	Port naming convention
			69 - port
			11 - node number
	windows and linux box will talk over that port
	usbportname will be the port used to connect to the meter. There can be multiple usbports on a node

	2)starting multiserver
	./multiserver &

	power pac is running for the GPU machine!!!!!!

fcontrol.h



results
	col 1 cpu
	col 2 memory
	col 3 user disc or motherboard(?) 
	col 4 user disc or motherboard(?)

	every line is 1 timestamp

	<COL1> <COL2> <COL3> <COL4> || <POWER MEASUREMENTS OF EACH RAIL>
	power measurements are aggregated into the first four columns.
	We can change the aggregation, but we need to recompile afterwards



have to use the multimeter to measure what each rail is assigned to
--run a benchmark targeting a specific rail and see which one is poppin' off


|wserver|
project folder

ContAcq-IntClk.c
--once hardware is done we have to record the voltage information into this file


vim multiserver.c
#define DEFAULT_METER_PORT <-- will have to change when setting up a new machine



P.S.
sometimes for the gpu machine, we can't map the rail to a single component
e.g. you see the same rail powering up on different benchmarks


needs PCIe riser cards
